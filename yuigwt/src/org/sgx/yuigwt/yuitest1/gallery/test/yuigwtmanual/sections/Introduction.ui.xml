	<h2>An overview of the project</h2>
	
	<p>
		In this document we document <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yuigwt/wiki/Usage">YUIGWT</a>
		a library for wrinting
		<a href="http://yuilibrary.com/" rel="nofollow"><abbr title="Yahoo User Interface">YUI</abbr></a>
		Applications in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/"><abbr title="Google Web Tookit">GWT</abbr></a>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>YUIGWT try to cover all the usefull YUI modules so the GWT user can use them in its 
	applications. Its main objective is to bring a complete Java API. Also the implementation of this API 
	must have zero overhead in the Java to JavaScript translation. Keep reading to understand what exactly
	means "usefull YUI modules" and "zero overhead". </p>
	
	
	<p>
		It is a GWT library mostly written using GWT overlay types for a zero-overhead Java API. Define common mechanism and Java utilities 
		for "doing javascript " in java, like literal JavaScript
		object definitions, function handlers, etc. Given those mechanism yuigwt implements a YUI java API based on the JavaScript
		YUI API in a very straightforward way. This also allows users already familiar with JavaScript
		YUI API to quickly get ready to use yuigwt Java API.
	</p>
	<p>
		The YUI API is huge. This Java API focus first on YUI concrete components like DOM utilities, widgets, gallery modules and other useful JavaScript
		tools.
	</p>
	<p>However, YUI modules and utilities oriented to enhance the Javascript language, like YUI extensions mechanisms, extending Base, Attribute, custom events, and in
		general, any YUI module which function is already covered by the Java language or by GWT will take less priority in YUIGWT road map.  </p>
	<p>
		Most of the (concrete) YUI API is
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/yuigwt/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fyuigwt%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fsgx%2Fyuigwt%2Fyui" rel="nofollow">supported</a>
		including
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/yuigwt/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fyuigwt%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fsgx%2Fyuigwt%2Fyui%2Fwidget" rel="nofollow">widgets</a>
		. Also a growing list of YUI Gallery modules are
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/yuigwt/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fyuigwt%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fsgx%2Fyuigwt%2Fyuigallery" rel="nofollow">supported</a>
		in a separate GWT module
		<tt>org.sgx.yuigwt.YuiGwtYuiGallery</tt>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some integration with GWT tools and API like with DOM, Widget and UIBinder is supported. For example, see the
		<a href="http://cancerbero.mbarreneche.com/yuigwt/gallery/?test=uibinderuserguide&amp;singleTest=1" rel="nofollow">YUI+UIBinder User Guide</a>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is an
		<a href="http://cancerbero.mbarreneche.com/yuigwt/gallery/" rel="nofollow">example gallery</a>
		with specific examples with java source code available. The gallery will be showing current advances on the YUI Java API.
		In fact this User Guide is one of the Gallery's example, and it is writing fully using YUIGWT.
