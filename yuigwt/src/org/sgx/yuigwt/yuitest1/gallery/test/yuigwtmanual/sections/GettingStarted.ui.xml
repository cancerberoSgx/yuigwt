	<p>This section will show you how to quickly build a new YUIGWT application so you can start
	playing with YUI in Java by yourself. </p>
	
	<p>We will use YUI files directly from <a href="yui.yahooapis.com">YUI CDN</a> because it is easier. In a later section 
	we will show you also how to include the entire YUI build inside your own application
	so you can serve all YUI files entirely from your server instead having to be connected to internet for you application to work. </p>
