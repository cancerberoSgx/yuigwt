<p>
	This is the main example gallery of project
	 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yuigwt/">yuigwt</a>, a <a href="http://yuilibrary.com">YUI</a>
	 Java API for GWT made by Sebasti√°n Gurin.
</p>

<p>This gallery application itself was made with yuigwt, for demonstrate its power.
About the code, yes I know, HTML markup should not be hardcoded like that, 
but it is there only for demonstration porpuses, so you have all the code, included
HTML, json, css, etc required for the test in a single file to read. </p>

<p>The project just started but it already contains several YUI modules ready to be used in your GWT applications. </p>
