This means there are ten single-digit numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) before the first two-digit number, 10.  Sometimes it is useful to work with numbers in other bases.  Base 2, base 8, and base 16 tend to come up frequently in programming.  JavaScript provides a toString method on numbers which can convert a number to any base from base 2 to base 36 and a parseInt function for converting the strings back into numbers.  For bases greater than 10, lower-case letters are used for single digits greater than 9.  For example, base 16 uses these single-digit numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, and f.\r\n\r\nY.AnyBaseConverter is very similar to number.toString and parseInt except it can convert to and from bases greater than 36 and use a custom alphabet to represent the single-digit numbers.  In addition to any convenient mathematical properties, it may be helpful to convert to a higher base as a simple way to compress a large number as a string or to use a custom alphabet as a method of obfuscation.\r\n\r\nMore information about positional notation and bases:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1340223023","buildtag":"gallery-2012.06.20-20-07","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/any-base-converter/gallery-2012.06.20-20-07","tags":["alphabet","convert","converter","number","radix","solmsted","base","string"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/app-loading","module":"app-loading","requires":"app","title":"App Loading","summary":"This Y.App extension adds events, callbacks, and configuration properties for loading sequences","description":"This Y.App extension adds two custom events, two callbacks, and related configuration attributes to give you the ability to easily create loading sequences in your application for long running models, view renderings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe loading sequence will start automatically on navigate or view change but you can also trigger it manually by firing 'loading' or stop the sequence by firing 'loadingComplete'","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1336595371","buildtag":"gallery-2012.05.09-20-27","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10571\" title=\"View Profile\">Jeff Pihach</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10571","username":"hatch","email":"jpihach@partpal.com","fullname":"Jeff Pihach","github":"hatched","twitter":"fromanegg","tz":"-6.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992289be0893ac56a1a56f6dd623e428?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/app-loading/gallery-2012.05.09-20-27","tags":["hatch","app","loading"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/array-iterate","module":"array-iterate","requires":"yui","title":"Array Iterate","summary":"Iterate through an array.","description":"Y.Array.each and Y.Array.some are useful methods with a convenient API.

Implemented differently.","description":"This module is a rewrite of gallery-asyncronouscommandqueue.  What started as a little utility which fixed a single use case has become a tool that I find myself using frequently.  I began noticing certain patterns forming in my code to accomplish certain types of tasks, plus just a lot of boilerplate syntax required to instantiate all these objects.  The goal of this rewrite was to make asynchronous command queues feel like a more natural solution to more use cases and to make them require less typing.  I've also factored out some less common features and made them plugins.\r\n\r\n&quot;Synchronous programming is disrespectful and should not be employed in applications which are used by people.&quot; - Douglas Crockford\r\n\r\nAsynchronous events are a wonderful tool, especially for web application development. Unfortunately, they can create a couple difficult situations and many developers attempt to avoid them by using synchronous XHR or busy waiting or something worse.  Async aims to provide a clean solution for these situations, reducing spaghetti code and putting the developer in control of when things happen.\r\n\r\nAny asynchronous event and callback function can be expressed as an AsyncCommand object. It could be an io request, YQL, JSONP, a callback from an animation, a DOM event, a user input dialog or form submit, events from widgets, web sockets, web workers, or anything that uses a callback function.\r\n\r\nAsync will help you in two ways:\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple asynchronous events that need to occur in a specific order, instead of nesting callback functions in a confusing, ugly, and not very reusable way, Async helps by allowing you to define a single ordered array of commands.

Command Queue","summary":"This module has been replaced by gallery-async and gallery-async-command.","description":"This module has been replaced by gallery-async and gallery-async-command.\r\n\r\n&quot;Synchronous programming is disrespectful and should not be employed in applications which are used by people.&quot; - Douglas Crockford\r\n\r\nAsynchronous events are a wonderful tool, especially for web application development.  Unfortunately, they can create a couple difficult situations and many developers attempt to avoid them by using synchronous XHR or busy waiting or something worse.  Asynchronous Command Queue aims to provide a clean(ish) solution for these situations, reducing spaghetti code and putting the developer in control of when things happen.\r\n\r\nAny asynchronous event and callback function can be wrapped in an Asynchronous Command object.  It could be an io request, YQL, JSONP, or a callback from an animation or DOM event, a user input dialog or form submit, events from web workers, or anything else.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Command Queue will primarily help in these two situations:\r\n\r\nThere are multiple asynchronous events that need to occur in a specific order; one cannot begin until the previous one is completed.  Asynchronous Command Queue helps in this situation by defining the queue as a single array of commands.  This avoids the need to nest many levels of closures and callback functions.  The command function code can be read from top to bottom in order.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple asynchronous events that need to occur, order is unimportant, and the application needs to be informed when all of them have completed.  Asynchronous Command Queue helps in this situation by executing all of the commands right away.  Especially with multiple io requests, this increases front-end performance by taking advantage of parallel processing on the remote servers, instead of waiting for one response before requesting another.  The application can subscribe to the complete event to be sure that all commands have finished.\r\n\r\nEntire Asynchronous Command Queues can be nested to provide very fine control over the timing of complex event sequences.\r\n\r\nThere is only one drawback to using Asynchronous Command Queues.  Every Asynchronous Command MUST be manually completed.  It's easy to do: asynchronousCommand.fire('complete); but it's also easy to forget to do.  If any Asynchronous Command does not complete, the Asynchronous Command Queue will stop firing events and anything in the application waiting on those events will never run.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1302734384","buildtag":"gallery-2011.04.13-22-38","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/asynchronouscommandqueue/gallery-2011.04.13-22-38","tags":["solmsted","command","event","callback","asynchronous","queue"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/audio","module":"audio","requires":"node","optional":"gallery-modernizr","title":"Audio","summary":"Utility to create an HTML 5 Audio Node using the best audio format supported by the browser.","description":"This is a utility to create an HTML 5 Audio element.

The default implementation uses an HTML table.\r\n\r\nBulk Editor allows creating records, removing records, and modifying records, so it is useful both for creating new records and editing existing records.  Bulk Editor also supports both client-side and server-side pagination.\r\n\r\nClient-side pagination is the fastest and provides the most flexibility, because it allows best-effort saving: acceptable values can be saved, acceptable insertions and removals can be processed, and then validation errors can be displayed for invalid values.\r\n\r\nServer-side pagination must be used when it is not feasible to transfer all the data to the client.  In this case, you can only save all-or-nothing because the data returned by the server must be immutable during the edit process.\r\n\r\nOne example of server-side pagination is bulk upload of data.  The file is uploaded to the server, parsed (accepting any errors), and stored in a scratch space.  Then Bulk Editor is invoked to allow the user to verify the data and fix the errors.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1343827091","buildtag":"gallery-2012.08.01-13-16","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807\" title=\"View Profile\">John Lindal</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807","username":"jafl","email":"github@newplanetsoftware.com","fullname":"John Lindal","github":"jafl","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38f9e2bde80f6645036885d233609d69?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/bulkedit/gallery-2012.08.01-13-16","tags":["upload","jafl","data","table","edit","bulk","form"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/busyoverlay","module":"busyoverlay","requires":["node-screen","node-style","plugin","node-pluginhost"],"title":"Busy Overlay","summary":"Plugin for Nodes and Widgets that displays an overlaying div.

Numbers are probably the worst solution for performance, but they should work everywhere.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1340223060","buildtag":"gallery-2012.06.20-20-07","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/composite-image/gallery-2012.06.20-20-07","tags":["pixel","channel","color","picture","multidimensional","multichannel","image","graphics","dimension","composite","solmsted"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/console-test","module":"console-test","requires":["console","plugin","test"],"title":"Console Test Plugin","summary":"This plugin for YUI 3 Console displays a menu of all the test suites registered with Y.Test.Runner and lets you run them all at once or individually.","description":"This plugin for YUI 3 Console displays a menu of all the test suites registered with Y.Test.Runner and lets you run them all at once or individually.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1337200921","buildtag":"gallery-2012.05.16-20-37","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807\" title=\"View Profile\">John Lindal</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807","username":"jafl","email":"github@newplanetsoftware.com","fullname":"John Lindal","github":"jafl","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38f9e2bde80f6645036885d233609d69?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/console-test/gallery-2012.05.16-20-37","tags":["test","plugin","console","jafl"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/conway","module":"conway","requires":["array-extras","gallery-async","gallery-soon"],"title":"Conway's Game of Life Simulator","summary":"A simulator for Conway's Game of Life.","description":"A simulator for Conway's Game of Life.

It helps perform all of the necessary matrix calculations.  This is sort of an implementation of the CSSMatrix object defined in this spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#cssmatrix-interface  The matrix defined in the spec is a 3x2 matrix.  I'm not exactly an expert at matrix math, but most of the operations required by the spec only work with square matrices.  The spec doesn't explain how a 3x2 matrix is supposed to do these things.  In order to make the math work correctly, this object internally treats it as the 4x4 matrix defined in the 3d CSS transforms spec here: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-3d-transforms/#cssmatrix-interface and it converts the 3x2 matrix into a 4x4 matrix by following the examples provided in this spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-transforms-20120403/  Other implementations of these specs, like the WebKitCSSMatrix object and others that have copied it, attempt to combine both the 2d and 3d versions of CSSMatrix into the same object.  This implementation only borrows ideas from the 3d version to make the math make sense, but only the 2d functionality is implemented.  Since only the 6 2d matrix items out of the total 16 3d matrix items are mutable, and the remaining 3d matrix items are known to be either 0 or 1, most of the complicated 4x4 matrix math is factored down and reduced, becoming much more efficient.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1334238776","buildtag":"gallery-2012.04.12-13-50","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/cssmatrix2d/gallery-2012.04.12-13-50","tags":["transform","solmsted","skew","scale","rotate","matrix","inverse","css","translate"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datafinder","module":"datafinder","requires":["datasource-local","base"],"optional":"datasource","title":"Data Finder","summary":"A utility class that works in conjunction with a DataSource instance to submit queries and return RecordSets.","description":"The DataFinder class is a utility that works with a Y.DataSource instance to generate query strings, keep track of previously set query parameters, and turn a list of results into a RecordSet.

This will \r\n// load the dispatcher module and all the required dependencies. \r\nYUI().use(&quot;gallery-dispatcher&quot;, function(Y) {\r\n  var obj = new Y.Dispatcher({\r\n    node: '#demo'\r\n  });\r\n  // Setting a simple content\r\n  obj.set('content', '&lt;p&gt;content that will be injected within #demo&lt;/p&gt;');\r\n  // Loading a fragment through AJAX\r\n  obj.set('uri', '/get/html/fragment.php');\r\n});}}}\r\n\r\nUse &quot;uri&quot; or &quot;content&quot; attributes to inject new content within a &quot;node&quot;:\r\n\r\n* content: to inject a html fragment into a Node.\r\n* uri: to use io module to load an html fragment and inject it into a Node.\r\n* normalize: set to true to enabling normalization process in you plan to inject a html document instead of a regular html fragment.\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous events that you can listen for during the life cycle as well, check the documentation for more details.\r\n\r\nMore attributes and other details here:\r\n\r\n* http://caridy.github.com/api/gallery-dispatcher/Y.Dispatcher.html\r\n\r\n==Examples==\r\n\r\n* http://caridy.github.com/examples/gallery-dispatcher/simple.html\r\n\r\n==Tests==\r\n\r\nRun this test in your browser and report any issue. \r\n\r\n* http://caridy.name/sandbox/yui3-gallery/src/gallery-dispatcher/tests/dispatcher.html\r\n\r\nNote: Make sure you include OS, Browser Version and the test result from YUI Console in your ticket.\r\n\r\n==CHANGELOG==\r\n\r\nCheck the latest changes in this module.\r\n\r\n* http://github.com/caridy/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-dispatcher/","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1305206929","buildtag":"gallery-2011.05.12-13-26","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=74\" title=\"View Profile\">Caridy Patino</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=74","username":"caridy","email":"caridy@gmail.com","fullname":"Caridy Patino","github":"caridy","twitter":"caridy","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"false","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_gold.png\" title=\"YUI Developer\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fef48709416e18e4ccb263b248fd88e1?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/dispatcher/gallery-2011.05.12-13-26","tags":["ajax","caridy","dispatcher","io","bubbling","javascript"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/dom-node-removeclass","module":"dom-node-removeclass","requires":["dom","node"],"title":"DOM Node removeClass","summary":"Remove multiple/single classes at once: node.removeClass('foo bar baz');","description":"This module overrides DOM, Node and NodeList .removeClass methods, it allows removing multiple or single classes at once like the popular framework jQuery does.\r\nIt reduces the number of chainning, i.e.: node.removeClass('foo').removeClass('bar') becomes node.removeClass('foo bar') and has some performance improvement (see performance test page and source code).","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1283368390","buildtag":"gallery-2010.09.01-19-12","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5755\" title=\"View Profile\">Marcel Duran</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5755","username":"marcelduran","email":"contact@marcelduran.com","fullname":"Marcel Duran","github":"marcelduran","twitter":"","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc737e594a6b0762831a5e37b3a9990?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/dom-node-removeclass/gallery-2010.09.01-19-12","tags":["remove","classes","multiple","dom","nodelist","class","removeclass","node","marcelduran"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/dropdown","module":"dropdown","requires":["node","event","gallery-simple-menu"],"title":"Dropdown","summary":"Transforms simple HTML select to div based dropdown structure","description":"How to Use:-\r\n        new Y.HTML.DropDown({&quot;src&quot;:&quot;#sel1&quot;, &quot;resize&quot;:false});\r\n        new Y.HTML.DropDown({&quot;src&quot;:&quot;#sel2&quot;});\r\n        \r\n     Dropdown plugin take two parameters\r\n      src    -

Event bubbling is quite useful when working with the DOM and equally so when working with custom events.\r\n\r\nEventTarget has an added feature that DOM nodes don't have, an EventTarget can have multiple bubble targets.  An event will bubble to the bubble targets in the order that they were added.  If the first bubble target itself has bubble targets, the event will bubble to them before continuing to the second bubble target.  This creates a branching tree-like pattern of event bubbling.\r\n\r\nCurrently, EventFacade seems to be modelled after DOM events, containing methods such as halt, preventDefault, stopImmediatePropagation, and stopPropagation.  These methods work quite well when dealing with a single bubble target per EventTarget, but they do not offer much help when you wish to control multiple bubble target branches separately.\r\n\r\nThis module adds the following branch specific methods to EventFacade: haltBranch, preventBranchDefault, stopBranchPropagation, stopImmediateBranchPropagation.  This allows you to control the bubbling of a branch without changing the default behavior of another branch.\r\n\r\nThis module rewrites a lot of YUI's custom event system and therefore it is very difficult to maintain.

Since the officially published specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) was last updated in 2009, when question arose about implementation details, the editor's draft (http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) was used for clarification. \r\n\r\nServer-Sent Events are a form of Comet communication. As opposed to Web Sockets, Server-Sent Events can be implemented over regular HTTP using a long-lived connection. The response must have a content type of &quot;text/event-stream&quot; and output buffering must be turned off to ensure the browser receives timely data.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to implement an event stream. One is to use long polling (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#Ajax_with_long_polling), where a request is kept open until data is sent. At that point, the connection is closed by the server and the client reopens the connection to wait for more data. This auto-reconnect feature is central to Server-Sent Events. The second approach is to use HTTP streaming (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#Streaming), which keeps a single connection open to the client and sends repeated data through the connection without closing it. \r\n\r\nFirefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera all support HTTP streaming either through XMLHttpRequest or through a native implementation of EventSource (the main object for Server-Sent Events). Internet Explorer through version 9 does not support HTTP streaming. For optimal compatibility, it's recommended to use long polling as the primary mechanism for your event stream. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to optimize for the browsers that support HTTP streaming. When this module is run in a browser that doesn't support HTTP streaming, a special &quot;X-YUIEventSource-PollOnly&quot; header is sent. You can use this to determine whether to use long polling or HTTP streaming. The following is a simple example in JSP:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n&lt;%@page contentType=&quot;text/event-stream&quot; buffer=&quot;none&quot;%&gt;\r\n&lt;%\r\n    //check for poll-only header\r\n    String header = request.getHeader(&quot;X-YUIEventSource-PollOnly&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    //check every so often to see if there's new data\r\n    while(true) {\r\n        \r\n        //sleep for a second - simulate waiting for data\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n        \r\n        //output the current time, ensure there are two trailing newlines\r\n        out.print(&quot;data: &quot; + (new java.util.Date()).toString() + &quot;xnn&quot;);\r\n        out.flush();\r\n        \r\n        //if it's a poll-only request, break the loop, which ends the request - the client will reconnect\r\n        if (header != null){\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n%&gt;\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThis module implements most of the Server-Sent Events spec, by does not implement the retry option due to lack of clarity as to how this should be implemented.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1290029649","buildtag":"gallery-2010.11.17-21-32","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=109\" title=\"View Profile\">Nicholas C.

For example, if you have an application that writes a lot of files, all of the fs methods fail if you try to create a new file in a directory that does not exist.  This requires you to check if the parent directory exists, and if it doesn't exist, create it before creating a new file.  That is an awful lot of extra code to add to each file write, especially if you strive to avoid synchronous file system access.\r\n\r\nYou could wrap that directory check logic up into a function but there are also concurrency issues to deal with.  If your application calls that function repeatedly to write a bunch of files to a non existent directory, since we're dealing with asynchronous file system access, each call will see that the directory is missing and attempt to create it.  The first one that successfully creates the directory will win and all of the others will throw errors because the directory already exists.\r\n\r\nThis module provides these higher level functions and makes use of gallery-mutex to help avoid concurrency issues.  Unfortunately this doesn't help when running clusters or when multiple processes are attempting to access the same files at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis module is a work in progress.  It is currently not well documented or tested.  It's not a complete solution to every Node.js file system difficulty but it's at least a start.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"0","buildtag":"","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"","tags":["system","solmsted","fs","nodejs","file"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/flickpanel","module":"flickpanel","requires":["node","event","event-flick","event-move","plugin"],"title":"Flick Panel","summary":"Plug this into a sidebar or other panel so you can flick it in and out of view.","description":"==Abstract==\r\n\r\nFlick Panel was created so that you can easily tuck a sidebar or other panel out of view. By flicking the page, you slide open the flickPanel.\r\n\r\n==Features==\r\n\r\nYou can animate the main element of your page to the side along with the flickPanel, or the flickPanel can slide over the main element.\r\n\r\nFlickPanel offers a pullTab. Typically you'd style this so it appears to be a tab on the side of your panel. You can then drag the panel open via the tab. This is nice if you'd prefer to have it feel very physical, with direct user control. You can also make the pullTab full-height and transparent, so that it appears that you're dragging the flickPanel open just by dragging from anywhere on the edge of the page.\r\n\r\nYou can open the flickPanel by firing an event, &quot;flickpanel.toggle.click&quot;. This means you can wire up a toggle button anywhere in your UI and have it control the flickPanel. This is nice if you'd rather control it via an explicit button rather than a harder-to-discover gesture. You can also have both!\r\n\r\nTo gauge user interest in the feature, FlickPanel fires events &quot;flickpanel.open&quot; and &quot;flickpanel.close&quot;.\r\n\r\nFlickPanel is a YUI3 plugin, so it can easily be plugged and unplugged. For instance, if there's not enough viewport to contain your panel, you can plug it in. If the user changes orientation or resizes their window, you can unplug it.\r\n\r\nFlickPanel has some rather sophisticated interpreting of user gesture intent, so that a diagonal flick to scroll the page doesn't get interpreted as a flick to open the flickPanel.\r\n\r\n==Setup==\r\nSome setup is required for the elements you wish to interact with. Typically you'd set up a main div with a sidebar positioned absolutely beside it, just off screen. E.g., \r\n\r\n    .flickPanel {\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        width: 15em;\r\n        left: -15em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFlickPanel will handle the rest. If FlickPanel is not initialized, the panel will stay off-screen. When plugged, FlickPanel measures the width of the panel and translates both main and panel the appropriate distance.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1340827952","buildtag":"gallery-2012.06.27-20-10","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=14664\" title=\"View Profile\">James Alley</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=14664","username":"pakjeem","email":"manalagi001@yahoo.com","fullname":"James Alley","github":"jamesalley","twitter":"james_alley","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1652cde27b8e5c886367f00e76d1277?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/flickpanel/gallery-2012.06.27-20-10","tags":["panel","mobile","ui","jamesalley","james_alley","manalagi001","manalagi","pakjeem","sliding","flick","gesture"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/flickr-api","module":"flickr-api","requires":["event","dump","substitute","json-parse"],"optional":"io-xdr","title":"Flickr API","summary":"A Flickr API IO module.","description":"This gallery module is designed to make requests to the Flickr API as simple as possible.

It provides default value management, client-side pre-validation, and field-level messaging.  This is a YUI3 port of code that has been in production on customer-facing sites since 2004.","description":"HTML forms are complex beasts, requiring insertion of default values when the form is first displayed, possible auto-saving of unvalidated input to protect against connection loss, client-side pre-validation of user input, synchronous/asynchronous submission of user input to the server, and processing and display of the results returned by the server (success or errors). When combined with YUI3 IO, FormMgr supports all of this.\r\n\r\nThis module is lightweight because it does not instantiate a separate JavaScript object for each form element.  Instead, basic pre-validation configuration is stored in each element's class.  Custom pre-validations can be added either by registering a regular expression and/or function for a particular element or by overriding postValidateForm().\r\n\r\nThis approach is ideal when implementing progressive enhancement:  the form is defined via markup, and FormManager is then used to add functionality when JavaScript is enabled.  Even then error message containers are in the markup, and this allows the server to populate them for non-JavaScript clients.\r\n\r\nWe refer to client-side checks as &quot;pre-validation&quot; because JavaScript is relatively easy to subvert -- or it might be turned off completely by the user.  Only the server can truly validate that the data is acceptable.\r\n\r\nMore information is provided in the YUI Blog post: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/03/23/gallery-form-manager/","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1337803218","buildtag":"gallery-2012.05.23-19-56","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807\" title=\"View Profile\">John Lindal</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5807","username":"jafl","email":"github@newplanetsoftware.com","fullname":"John Lindal","github":"jafl","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38f9e2bde80f6645036885d233609d69?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/formmgr/gallery-2012.05.23-19-56","tags":["form","validation","jafl"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/formmgr-css-validation","module":"formmgr-css-validation","requires":"substitute","title":"Form Manager CSS Validation","summary":"Utility for validating the values of form elements based on CSS classes.","description":"Utility for validating the values of form elements based on CSS classes.

An entity can have '''non-linear''' rating stops. Eg. A movie can have random or even exponential rating values 1, 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536 (If the movie is awesome!)\r\n\r\n2. No restrictions to the '''number''' of rating stops for an entity. Eg. Use the widget to rate a movie as 1, 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536  (i.e 6 rating stops) or to rate a more widely spread satisfaction level from your porsche as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (i.e 10 rating stops)\r\n\r\n3. '''Custom legend''' to each rating stop. Eg. 1 - Awful, 2 - Poor, 3 - Foo, 4 - Bar, 5 - Excellent\r\n\r\n4. Each rating box, representing a rating stop, in the heat bar can have '''custom colors'''.\r\n\r\n5. Widget is '''progressively enhanced''' from a select/input html element and is ''initialized'' with its value.\r\n{{{&lt;select id=&quot;myRatingParam&quot; name=&quot;myRatingParam&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Awful&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Poor&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;3&quot; selected=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;Average&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Good&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Excellent&lt;/option&gt;\r\n&lt;/select&gt;}}}will replace the select box, with heat bar rater widget already initialized to ''3'' on render.\r\n\r\n6. Widget enables '''POST''' rating back to the server through ''AJAX'' as well as ''Form-Submit''.\r\n{{{&lt;select id=&quot;myRating&quot; name=&quot;myRating&quot;&gt;\r\n    ......\r\n&lt;/select&gt;}}}will render a heat bar rater widget, with a hidden input element as -{{{&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; id=&quot;myRating&quot; name=&quot;myRating&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;}}}This way page can POST rating as myRating=&quot;3&quot; transparently to the back-end server, which has no knowledge of 'select' box being replaced by 'heat bar rater' widget on the front-end.\r\n\r\n7. Widget '''broadcasts its ratingChange event''' to YUI instance. So any module lets say average-rating, which is set to the average of various rating parameters, can listen to these events without having a direct handle to heat bar rating widgets.\r\n\r\n\r\n","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1280347681","buildtag":"gallery-2010.07.28-20-07","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8956\" title=\"View Profile\">Amrish Kapoor</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8956","username":"amrishk","email":"kapoor.amrish@gmail.com","fullname":"Amrish Kapoor","github":"amrishk","twitter":"amrishk","tz":"5.50","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/847045f83debb71a2134c42cf0c7fbd2?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/heat-bar-rater/gallery-2010.07.28-20-07","tags":"amrishk"},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/history-check","module":"history-check","requires":"node","title":"History Check","summary":"This module gives you an easy mechanism to determine if a user's browser history contains a link.","description":"This module takes a list of URLs and either returns a list of URLs that are contained within the user's browser history or a boolean depending on how you invoke it.

It's ready to use as soon as it's on the page.\r\n* '''You don't need to register history parameters''' before using them.\r\n* '''You may add parameters to the history state at any time''', since there's no initialization step and no parameter registration requirement. This makes it easy for multiple discrete components to share the history state without having to be aware of one another's needs ahead of time.\r\n* '''Smaller code footprint than the BHM''' as a result of the minimal API and lack of IE6/7 support.

Also adds Y.jsonrpc(url, method, paramArray, callback) method.","description":"===Construction and configuration===\r\n{{{\r\nvar api = new Y.JSONRPC({\r\n    url: serviceUrl,\r\n    methods: [ 'doThis', 'doThat' ], // optional. If provided, will disable construction-time API fetch\r\n    version: 2, // optional. Default 2. RPC version. If &gt; 1, will be identified in the outbound payload\r\n    preload: false, // optional. Default true.  Value false disables construction-time API fetch\r\n    sync: false // optional. Default false. Value true enables synchronous io.  Please don't do this.\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n===Getting the remote API===\r\nOn construction, JSONRPC instances will send a GET request to the serviceUrl to fetch the API to simulate.  The notification event that the API has been received from the server is apiready.  If there is an issue in this transaction, the apierror event will fire instead.\r\n{{{\r\napi.on(&quot;apiready&quot;, function () {\r\n    // equivalent to api.doThis(...)\r\n    this.doThis(&quot;Args&quot;, &quot;are inline.&quot;, &quot;Last arg can be a &quot;, function (result) {...});\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nIf preload config is false, you can manually request the API to be loaded.\r\n{{{\r\nvar api = new Y.JSONRPC({ url: serviceUrl, preload: false });\r\n// ... at some later point\r\napi.loadAPI();\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nIf you know the method names you're working with, you don't need to fetch them.  Just name them in the methods configuration at instantiation.  If methods is configured, the default preload will be disabled.  Reenable it by passing a preload: true in the configuration, or just immediately call loadAPI();\r\n{{{\r\nvar api = new Y.JSONRPC({ url: serviceUrl, methods: [ 'doThis', 'doThat' ] });\r\napi.doThis(&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;, function (result) { ... });  // immediately available\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe least desirable option is to configure the instance to operate synchronously.  This will impact page performance, so have a very good reason to use this setting.\r\n{{{\r\nvar api = new Y.JSONRPC({ url: serviceUrl, sync: true });\r\napi._config.sync = false; // to set it back to async for API calls\r\napi.doThis();\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n===Using the remote API===\r\nAfter fetching the API, the method names identified by the server will have proxies generated on the instance.  All methods take any number of arguments, the last of which is the callback to execute with the response data.  Arguments and callback are optional.  You can pass N number of arguments, and not pass a callback, or pass just a callback with no arguments, or pass nothing.\r\n\r\nThe JSON response will be parsed, and unless there was an error, the callback will be executed with the content of the response object's result property (see request/response object structure below).\r\n{{{\r\napi.doThis(); // Just dispatch the method call to the server. Don't ask for a response\r\napi.doThis(&quot;with&quot;, &quot;params&quot;); // Again, don't ask for a response\r\napi.doThis(function (result) { ... }); // No parameter payload, but handle the response\r\napi.doThis(&quot;with&quot;, &quot;params and a callback&quot;, function (result) {\r\n    alert(result.message); // callback parameter is the JSON.parsed response\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nAnother approach similar to supplying the method names in the configuration object is to use the generic exec function to call any remote method.  Unlike the generated API methods, this method takes the remote method as the first arg and all outbound params as an array in the second arg.  The callback is third.\r\n{{{\r\napi.exec(&quot;doTheOtherThing&quot;, [ &quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;argN&quot; ], function (result) {...});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe callback can be either a success function or an io configuration object, allowing you to handle failures and other events.  Note, the data configuration will be overridden.\r\n{{{\r\napi.doThat(&quot;thing&quot;, {\r\n    context: altThisObj, // set 'this' in the callbacks\r\n    sync: true, // Seriously, don't do this, even for a single transaction\r\n    on: {\r\n        success: function (result) { // the function you would have passed as a final param\r\n            // note the callback still receives the result property from JSON.parse()d data\r\n            alert(result.message);\r\n        },\r\n        failure: function (err) {\r\n            // Typically, err will be an object with properties &quot;code&quot; and &quot;message&quot;, but may be different\r\n            // (until a future revision) if there was an IO related error.\r\n            Y.error(&quot;Uh oh! &quot; + err.message);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe Y.jsonrpc() method is also provided as a wrapper for the instantiation and dispatch steps.  It uses the same signature as exec, but with the serviceUrl prepended.\r\n{{{\r\nY.jsonrpc(serviceUrl, 'doThis', [ &quot;params&quot;, &quot;array&quot; ], function (result) {...});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n===Events===\r\nAs noted before, the apiready event fires when the API has been fetched from the server and the method proxies are in place.  apierror fires if something went wrong in the request.\r\n\r\napiready is configured with fireOnce, so subscribing after the API has been fetched will trigger immediate execution of the subscribed function.\r\n\r\nThe only other method not exposed through IO's on:{...} configuration is the dispatch event, which wraps the actual call to Y.io.  The event is preventable, and exposes the rpc payload object that will be sent to the server.  This gives you the opportunity to customize this object.\r\n{{{\r\napi.on(&quot;dispatch&quot;, function (e) {\r\n    e.rpcPayload.params.push(&quot;bacon&quot;); // Add an extra parameter\r\n    e.rpcPayload.newProperty = &quot;relevant info for the server&quot;;\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nOr stop the outbound call altogether.\r\n{{{\r\napi.on(&quot;dispatch&quot;, function (e) {\r\n    if (Y.Array.indexOf(e.rpcPayload.params, &quot;bacon&quot;) === -1) {\r\n        e.preventDefault(); // need moar bacon!\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n===Payload signature===\r\nloadAPI expects an object with an array of method names stored in the methods property.\r\n{{{\r\n{\r\n\r\n    envelope: &quot;JSON-RPC-1.0&quot;, // optional to override configured version to 1.0 (not spec'd?)\r\n    methods: [&quot;blarney&quot;, &quot;blimey&quot;, &quot;bilge&quot;, &quot;rum&quot;]\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe API method calls are dispatched as a JSON.stringify()ed object in the post data.  They have the following signature:\r\n{{{\r\n{\r\n\r\n    method: &quot;doThis&quot;,\r\n    params: [ &quot;go&quot;, &quot;team!&quot; ],\r\n    id: &quot;some long YUI generated unique id&quot;, // Only present if a callback is passed to the method\r\n    jsonrpc: &quot;2.0&quot; // Only present if the instance is configured with version greater than 1\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe response should be sent with mime-type 'application/json' and be a valid JSON serialization of an object in this form for successful operations:\r\n{{{\r\n{\r\n\r\n    id: &quot;some long YUI generated unique id&quot;,\r\n    jsonrpc: &quot;2.0&quot;, // Only present if the instance is configured with version greater than 1\r\n    result: ???, // The data that will be passed to the success callback\r\n    error: null\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nand this form for unsuccessful operations:\r\n{{{\r\n{\r\n\r\n    id: &quot;some long YUI generated unique id&quot;,\r\n    jsonrpc: &quot;2.0&quot;, // Again, only if applicable\r\n    error: {\r\n        code: -32601,\r\n        message: &quot;Procedure not found.&quot;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC for more details.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1336595389","buildtag":"gallery-2012.05.09-20-27","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=53\" title=\"View Profile\">Luke Smith</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=53","username":"lsmith","email":"lsmith@lucassmith.name","fullname":"Luke Smith","github":"lsmith","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"1","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_gold.png\" title=\"YUI Developer\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3974d5bcfbdb27cc99d10706dc5b85f7?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/jsonrpc/gallery-2012.05.09-20-27","tags":["lsmith","json","jsonrpc"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/jsonp","module":"jsonp","requires":["get","oop"],"title":"JSONP","summary":"Deprecated.

This module does not provide a visual rendering component but Y.Graphics or a Canvas element can serve that purpose.  gallery-cssmatrix2d can be quite helpful for implementing turtle graphics.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1342617916","buildtag":"gallery-2012.07.18-13-22","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/l-system/gallery-2012.07.18-13-22","tags":["biology","biological","botany","branching","fractal","geometry","growth","Lindenmayer","lsystem","parallel","plants","recursive","rewriting","solmsted","string","structures","system"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/laced-data","module":"laced-data","title":"Laced Data","summary":"Load model/modelList data from the initial HTML payload.","description":"When calling `load()` on a model with the `lacedSource` property set to an object or a string, load will use that data instead of calling the server.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for quicker boot of the application by having more data laced into the initial HTML payload.\r\nHaving it wrapping `load()` means that you can transparently have pages with laced data and pages that doesn't using the same load call.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"0","buildtag":"","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=15481\" title=\"View Profile\">Simon H&oslash;jberg</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=15481","username":"hojberg","email":"r.hackr@gmail.com","fullname":"Simon H&oslash;jberg","github":"hojberg","twitter":"null","tz":"1.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1d9ab8f97b20a630cbf065c3d1d2840?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"","tags":"hojberg"},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/axo-layout","module":"axo-layout","requires":["widget-parent","widget-child"],"optional":"resize","title":"Layout","summary":"Provides 1xN and Nx1 layouts, which can be nested to provide 5-unit layouts similar to yui2-layout.","description":"This layout module is based on 1xN and Nx1 layouts, which can be used alone or nested to combine more complex layouts such as the 5-unit layout from YUI2 Layout Manager.

Code size is reduced and what is left turns out to be much simpler.\r\n\r\nAll properties and methods added by MakeNode are protected, as they are meant to be used by the developer of the widget and need not be seen by the application developer using the widget.  \r\n\r\nMakeNode makes it easy to:\r\n* Define the markup of the Widget via a simple template which can have placeholders which MakeNode will fill with the values of properties, attributes, return values of methods and CSS classNames defined in the widget\r\n* Create classNames by simply declaring an array of suffixes to be added to the Widget's own CSS prefix\r\n* Create references to the Node elements that make up the widget by searching them by their classNames\r\n* Link attributes to methods that will reflect their state in the UI\r\n* Link UI events to methods that will listen to them\r\n* Link global and widget events to their listeners","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1321541807","buildtag":"gallery-2011.11.17-14-56","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=79\" title=\"View Profile\">Satyam</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=79","username":"satyam","email":"satyam@satyam.com.ar","fullname":"Satyam","github":"Satyam","twitter":"","tz":"0.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_gold.png\" title=\"YUI Developer\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83f0dfaa266dff4c90e90b451e988ccd?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/makenode/gallery-2011.11.17-14-56","tags":"satyam"},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/markdown","module":"markdown","title":"Markdown","summary":"A wrapper for https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js to support full Markdown rendering.","description":"Markdown is a format created by John Gruber that allows readable text to be easily converted into HTML markup.\r\n\r\nThis module allows you to do that easily!","license":"MIT license","license_url":"http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php","cdn":"1342617936","buildtag":"gallery-2012.07.18-13-22","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=15972\" title=\"View Profile\">J.

With the observer pattern, there is a subject and an observer. This requires the observer to have direct knowledge of the subject, such as your function knowing that the document object exists. The observer pattern works well when the environment is a well-known and constant ecosystem of objects, but doesn't work well when the ecosystem is unpredictable.\r\n\r\nThe mediator pattern solves this problem by establishing one permanent part of the ecosystem: the mediator. A colleague (an object that wishes to communicate with another object) can be assured that the mediator is always there but has no idea how many other colleagues exist. The colleague passes a message to the mediator and the mediator distributes it to interested colleagues. The interface is similar to an observer, but I have renamed the key methods as broadcast (to send a message) and listen (to receive a message) to avoid confusion with fire and on/attach for event targets.\r\n\r\nThis module provides a Y.Mediator type that is intended to be inherited from in a manner similar to Y.Event.Target (though you can use it directly).

This is true at a low level; JavaScript developers don't need to worry about race conditions between multiple processes or threads writing to the same memory location. At a higher level, asynchronous operations still allow for similar problems to occur.\r\n\r\nImagine a function that does the following:\r\n\r\n1.    Check the value of a variable.\r\n2.    If the value is undefined:\r\n.    1.    Make a request to a server.\r\n.    2.    Receive data.\r\n.    3.    Set the value of the variable.\r\n3.    Pass the variable to a callback function.\r\n\r\nIt seems common for web applications to lazy load data like this as needed. Now imagine that there are several separate modules within a web application which all require this data. It's possible for the first module to call this function, the function sees that the value is undefined, and sends a request to a server. Then before the request returns, the second module calls this function, the function sees that the value is undefined and sends a request to a server. Then before both of those requests return, the third module calls this function, the function sees that the value is undefined and sends a request to a server. In this case, three requests are made to a server for the same data.\r\n\r\nIt would be far better if the second and third calls to the function just waited for the first request to complete. Y.Mutex makes it easier to accomplish this functionality.\r\n\r\nY.Mutex provides a concept of locking a resource. Once an exclusive resource lock is obtained, other parts of an application which attempt to access the same resource, will have to wait until that resource is unlocked.\r\n\r\nThe function above could be rewritten as follows:\r\n\r\n1.    Obtain an exclusive lock for a variable.\r\n2.    Check the value of the variable.\r\n3.    If the value is undefined:\r\n.    1.    Make a request to a server.\r\n.    2.    Receive data.\r\n.    3.    Set the value of the variable.\r\n4.    Unlock the variable.\r\n5.    Pass the variable to a callback function.\r\n\r\nThis way, second or third or more calls to the function, before the first request is complete, will always wait for the request to complete instead of sending multiple unnecessary requests.\r\n\r\nJust like locking in multi threaded applications, there are disadvantages and dangers to locking. There is a small amount of overhead added to every resource access, even when the chances for concurrency issues are very small. Once a lock is obtained, it must be unlocked; so error handling and time outs are important to ensure that the entire application doesn't break when something goes wrong. It is possible to cause a deadlock when locking multiple resources at once.\r\n\r\nOne advantage Y.Mutex has in JavaScript over other multi threaded applications, the locks are asynchronous. The application is not blocked while waiting to acquire a lock. Even if a deadlock occurs, other parts of the application are not affected. Y.Mutex also provides multiple ways to cancel a particular lock, so there are extra possibilities to recover from locking errors.\r\n\r\nY.Mutex offers exclusive locks, shared locks, and upgradable locks. When a resource is locked by an exclusive lock, Y.Mutex guarantees that no other locks will be granted for the resource until the resource is unlocked. When a resource is locked by a shared lock, Y.Mutex allows the resource to be locked by an unlimited number of other shared locks at the same time and/or one single upgradable lock. When a resource is locked by multiple shared locks, an exclusive lock can not be obtained until all of the shared locks have been unlocked. An upgradable lock can be upgraded to act as an exclusive lock. Shared locks are generally used when just reading values. Exclusive locks are generally used when writing values.\r\n\r\nY.Mutex provides a way to deal with asynchronous concurrency issues, but it does not prevent them. If code from part of an application uses Y.Mutex to lock a resource, there is nothing stopping code from another part of the application from ignoring the lock and accessing the resource directly. Y.Mutex does not handle real multi threaded or multi process concurrency issues.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1335455505","buildtag":"gallery-2012.04.26-15-49","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071\" title=\"View Profile\">Steven Olmsted</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8071","username":"solmsted","email":"steven.olm@gmail.com","fullname":"Steven Olmsted","github":"solmsted","twitter":"null","tz":"-5.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_silver.png\" title=\"CLA Signed\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d49156801406cf2236d35e086149691a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/mutex/gallery-2012.04.26-15-49","tags":["shared","lock","resource","solmsted","exclusive","concurrent","concurrency","asynchronous","async","mutex"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/event-nav-keys","module":"event-nav-keys","requires":"event-synthetic","title":"Nav keys","summary":"Adds fast track events for subscribing to keydown for enter, esc, backspace, tab, pageUp, pageDown, and the arrow keys.","description":"Using the synthetic event API, creates custom DOM events for subscribing to keydown that reports a specific keyCode in the event.

They also (hopefully) have the effect of making the code a bit more human readable.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1296680941","buildtag":"gallery-2011.02.02-21-07","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=53\" title=\"View Profile\">Luke Smith</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=53","username":"lsmith","email":"lsmith@lucassmith.name","fullname":"Luke Smith","github":"lsmith","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"1","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_gold.png\" title=\"YUI Developer\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3974d5bcfbdb27cc99d10706dc5b85f7?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/event-nav-keys/gallery-2011.02.02-21-07","tags":["event","lsmith","synthetic","key","keyboard","accessibility"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/neon","module":"neon","requires":["node-style","node-pluginhost","anim-easing","plugin"],"title":"Neon Sign","summary":"Animates text to make it look like a neon sign that flickers when it is first turned on.","description":"Animates text to make it look like a neon sign that flickers when it is first turned on.

Check the gallery-slideshow/tests folder for the most current examples on how this module works.\r\n\r\nThe base implementation of Slideshow is designed to be as simple as possible, supporting displaying a series of images of identical size that cycle through the selection, optionally applying a supplied animation for the transition between images.\r\n\r\nFuture developments will use the plugin architecture to modify the behaviour to support things like images of different sizes and such.\r\n\r\nSupported Attributes (above what Widget supports):\r\n* images: An array of objects offering information about the images. See below\r\n* anim: The animation to apply, must be an instance of Y.Anim\r\n* delay: The time in milliseconds to display an image before beginning to transition to the next\r\n* image_height: The height of the image area of the widget. This should be smaller than the overall height, if set.\r\n* image_width: The width of the image area of the widget. This should be smaller than the overall width, if set.\r\n* title: The title to apply to the slideshow.\r\n\r\nThe Images structure:\r\n* src: The URI to load in the image tag\r\n\r\nThere are currently two plugins available for Slideshow,\r\n1. gallery-slideshow-image-scaler\r\n\r\nThis plugin will use the height and width properties for each item in the Images structure (or default values you provide when instantiating the plugin) to scale using CSS each image. Usually this isn't the correct thing to do.\r\n\r\n2. gallery-slideshow-image-padder\r\n\r\nThis plugin will apply padding around each image in order to center it in the content body area of the widget. This allows for slideshows to consist of images of different sizes cleanly, though it does require the background-color property on the .yui-slideshow-body to be set.","license":"YUI BSD","license_url":"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html","cdn":"1269367000","buildtag":"gallery-2010.03.23-17-54","featured":"0","owner":{"profile":"<a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=71\" title=\"View Profile\">Jeff Craig</a>","url":"http://yuilibrary.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=71","username":"foxxtrot","email":"foxxtrot@foxxtrot.net","fullname":"Jeff Craig","github":"foxxtrot","twitter":"null","tz":"-8.00","dst":"0","rank":"YUI Contributor","cla":"true","medal":"<img src=\"http://yuilibrary.com/assets/medal_gold.png\" title=\"YUI Developer\" class=\"medal\"> ","icon":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5e59f67101f60459b52161284605b9a?s=64&d=http://yuilibrary.com/assets/gravatar-64.png"},"buildtag_data":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/slideshow/gallery-2010.03.23-17-54","tags":["foxxtrot","widget","slideshow","images"]},{"url":"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/slideshow-animated","module":"slideshow-animated","requires":["gallery-slideshow-base","anim"],"title":"Slideshow Animated","summary":"The Animated Slideshow script easily converts html content into a slideshow.

Class names might look like this: yui3-name, yui3-name-content, yui3-name-hidden, etc.  When extending a widget, if a subclass has a different NAME, any css rules applied to the original widget's classes do not get inherited.\r\n\r\nThe subclass could be given the same NAME (or CSS_PREFIX) as the superclass, then the class attributes rendered by subclass and superclass would be the same and the superclass css would get applied to the subclass.  This works out well but the two widgets can't be styled independently.  It would be nice if the css would actually be allowed cascade from the superclass and be overwritten by the subclass.\r\n\r\nThe bounding box node rendered by the subclass does receive a class from the subclass and a class from the superclass.  Unfortunately the same is not true for any other nodes rendered by the widget.  Y.WidgetInheritCss is a class extension that fixes this situation.  Every time the subclass renders a class with its name it will also render a class with the superclass name.  This allows the css to cascade from the superclass and more specific rules can be written to target only the subclass.  This also works with special cases like -disabled and -hidden.
